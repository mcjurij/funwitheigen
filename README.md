A DFT using the Eigen library. It's just me playing around.

Build and use instructions in the source file.

They code is translated from DFT Python code as shown in 
[Diskrete Fouriertransformation (DFT) / Abtasttheorem (Shannon, Nyquist, Kotelnikow)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX-DNi_SX-Q) by Prof. Weitz.

You need the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library. After unpacking the tarball, rename the directory to eigen (to make -Ieigen on the g++ command line work).

To see the output as a graph (see saw17.png) you need a plotter like gnuplot.
